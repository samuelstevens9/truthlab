                                            more Truthlab ordering documents signed by the Parties (each an “Order”).
                                            The Platform includes, but is not limited to, software to manage the
                                            participants (“Tester(s)”) who participate in usability and user experience

                                            Orders, including any addenda and exhibits, are collectively referred to as

                                            meanings attributed to them in the Order.</p>

                                        <p>1.2 Procurement and Provisioning by Affiliates. Customer may use the Platform
                                            under this Agreement for its own account and on behalf of one or more
                                            Customer Affiliates (defined below). Customer is responsible for the acts
                                            and omissions of Customer Affiliates under any Order pursuant to which the
                                            Customer Affiliate receives the benefit of the Platform but is not a
                                            signatory. Additionally, Customer Affiliates may procure the Platform
                                            directly under this Agreement pursuant to an Order executed by such Customer
                                            Affiliate and Truthlab. Customer Affiliates who sign an Order will be deemed
                                            to be the Customer hereunder and solely responsible for its performance or
                                            non-performance thereunder. “Affiliate” means any legal entity directly or
                                            indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with a Party,
                                            where control means the ownership of a majority share of the stock, equity
                                            or voting interests of such entity. </p>

                                        <p>1.3 Platform Users. During the term (“Subscription Term”) set forth in each
                                            Order, Truthlab will make the Platform available to Customer and its
                                            authorized Affiliates, employees, agents or contractors (“Users”), for
                                            access and use by such Users solely for Customer’s internal business
                                            purposes in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Customer is
                                            responsible for use of the Platform by Users and any party who accesses the
                                            Platform with Customer’s or a User’s account credentials.</p>

                                            the Platform in a service bureau or outsourcing offering.</p>

                                        <p>2.2 Usage Rights. Customer will always ensure that its use of the Platform
                                            does not exceed the usage terms specified in the Order (“Usage Rights”). If
                                            Truthlab determines that Customer is exceeding the Usage Rights, Truthlab
                                            will notify Customer, and Customer will have 30 days from the date of notice
                                            to bring its usage within the limits of such Usage Rights. If Customer fails
                                            to do so within 30 days, Truthlab has the right to charge Customer, and
                                            Customer agrees to pay, for the applicable usage tier, which will be
                                            co-termed with the Subscription Term in the applicable Order.</p>

                                        <p>2.3 Suspension. Truthlab may immediately suspend Customer's account and
                                            access to the Platform if (i) Customer fails to make payment due within 10
                                            business days after Truthlab has provided Customer with written notice of

                                        <p>1.1 Scope. These terms apply to Customer’s use of the online services and
                                            related online training and if applicable, packaged professional services
                                            offered by Truthlab (collectively, the “Platform”) that are listed in one or
                                            more Truthlab ordering documents signed by the Parties (each an “Order”).
                                            The Platform includes, but is not limited to, software to manage the
                                            participants (“Tester(s)”) who participate in usability and user experience

                                            Orders, including any addenda and exhibits, are collectively referred to as

                                        <p>1.2 Procurement and Provisioning by Affiliates. Customer may use the Platform
                                            under this Agreement for its own account and on behalf of one or more
                                            Customer Affiliates (defined below). Customer is responsible for the acts
                                            and omissions of Customer Affiliates under any Order pursuant to which the
                                            Customer Affiliate receives the benefit of the Platform but is not a
                                            signatory. Additionally, Customer Affiliates may procure the Platform
                                            directly under this Agreement pursuant to an Order executed by such Customer
                                            Affiliate and Truthlab. Customer Affiliates who sign an Order will be deemed
                                            to be the Customer hereunder and solely responsible for its performance or
                                            non-performance thereunder. “Affiliate” means any legal entity directly or
                                            indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with a Party,
                                            where control means the ownership of a majority share of the stock, equity
                                            or voting interests of such entity. </p>

                                        <p>1.3 Platform Users. During the term (“Subscription Term”) set forth in each

                                            purposes in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Customer is

                                            the Platform in a service bureau or outsourcing offering.</p>

                                        <p>2.2 Usage Rights. Customer will always ensure that its use of the Platform
                                            does not exceed the usage terms specified in the Order (“Usage Rights”). If
                                            Truthlab determines that Customer is exceeding the Usage Rights, Truthlab
                                            will notify Customer, and Customer will have 30 days from the date of notice
                                            to bring its usage within the limits of such Usage Rights. If Customer fails
                                            to do so within 30 days, Truthlab has the right to charge Customer, and
                                            Customer agrees to pay, for the applicable usage tier, which will be
                                            co-termed with the Subscription Term in the applicable Order.</p>

                                        <p>2.3 Suspension. Truthlab may immediately suspend Customer's account and

                                            business days after Truthlab has provided Customer with written notice of
